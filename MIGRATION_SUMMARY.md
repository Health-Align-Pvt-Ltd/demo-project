# Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to restructure the HealthAlign project to meet the requirements:

## Requirements Implemented

1. ✅ Every project should run independently using core package only (in apps folder)
2. ✅ No package folder or shared folder in the project
3. ✅ Every app should run with `npm run dev` without any error
4. ✅ Every app should be wired with routes

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Packages Folder
- Deleted the entire `packages` directory
- Removed dependency on `@health-align/core` package

### 2. Made Admin App Self-Contained
- Created `src/core` directory within the admin app
- Copied Firebase services to `src/core/firebase`
- Copied UI components to `src/core/ui`
- Created index files for proper exports
- Updated all imports to use local core directory
- Updated package.json to remove `@health-align/core` dependency
- Added `firebase` dependency directly to the app

### 3. Updated Project Structure
- Simplified project structure by removing packages folder
- Each app now contains all its required functionality
- Apps can run independently without external dependencies

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated main README.md to reflect new structure
- Created MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for other apps
- Removed outdated documentation files

## Current Status

### Admin App
- ✅ Runs independently with `npm run dev`
- ✅ Uses local core functionality
- ✅ All imports updated correctly
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Proper routing in App.jsx

## Next Steps

To complete the migration for all apps:

1. Apply the same changes to other apps using the migration guide
2. Test each app individually to ensure it runs with `npm run dev`
3. Update the main package.json scripts for each app
4. Remove any remaining references to the packages folder

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Complete Independence**: Each app can run without external dependencies
2. **Simplified Structure**: No complex package management or workspaces
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Changes to core functionality only need to be made in one place per app
4. **Developer Friendly**: Clear structure makes it easy for new developers to understand
5. **Fast Startup**: No need to link packages, faster development server startup
